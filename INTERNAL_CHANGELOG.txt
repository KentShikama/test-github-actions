Let's play a little game (no pressure to participate of course).
Search 'AORTA' on Slack in the #nerds channel.
Reply in the thread with a random noun that starts with the letter
corresponding to the number of letters in the previous person's word. For
example, since the first word in the thread is 'AORTA' with 5 letters, the
second person would put in a word starting with 'E' the 5th letter in the
alphabet like 'ELEPHANT'.
If someone makes a mistake or the thread becomes confusing, restart with the letter A.
